## Land of Lisp
### _Conrad Barski_

The files in this folder are my attempts to learn lisp through the book _Land of Lisp_

All text needs to be copied into the clisp REPL. As I learn more I plan on modifying them to run with user input instead of just using the REPL. This way they can be executed more like a normal script.
